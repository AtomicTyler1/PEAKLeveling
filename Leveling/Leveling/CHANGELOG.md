# v0.1.6 - Major Update, Automatic Backups

- Now backup your data with ease!
- Launch the game at least once to generate the config
- Go the config section of your mod manager and you should see a dropdown to load a backup.
- A backup is created each time you load the game, not as you quit, as the current save is that data.
